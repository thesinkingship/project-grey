<!--
This is a roguelike game that depends on obtaining information (score) and material types (upgrade currency) 
from randomly generated solar systems across a map.
Taking inspo from Blue Prince, travelling to and fro from different points upon the map requires Fuel. 
How this is spent is based on the distance between the two points, but the units of fuel and expenditure might be tweaked.
When on a solar system:
VERSION 1 - A popup will show, being able to select 1 out of n rows of perks, dependent on amount of planets.
VERSION 2 - The window to the right will be able to show details about the solar system and allow the spaceship to travel to each planet.
V3 - ??? ehh i'll tick things off
