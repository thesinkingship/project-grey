Emptiness:
A ship driving simulator. May be a roguelike.
Do: 
- A large map initially that loops in on itself.
    - Objects on said large map, which take the form of square zones. When the ship is hovering over it, allow the option to enter. Limit movement to 'charges'.
- A solar system image generator. Start on a generated system image and store that to local storage.
- Resource sampling and generation.

The Library room should be made in Blender as a nexus for places to go. Areas include:
The Bookshelf, which is presently being worked on.
A Cabinet of Curiosities to save the long trips as a fast travel point.

Big thing: DO EVERYTHING WITHOUT ASSETS FIRST!!! If I need markers, draw them as SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.
