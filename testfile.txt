This language does not have a name yet.
Random words instead of the intended English occasionally pop up when trying ot define something. This event is very rare, and I don't want to rush it.
Criteria is, it induces a level of innate and complete understanding amongst Isle-Bases, only demonstrating confusion when comparing it to actual English.

Vocabulary:
(Well, shit.)

Also, stuff to paraphrase in the rephrasal of the Emptiness' book:

<p>This is a transcription of terminal log information about the Isle of Isolation.<br><br>
    Designations<br>
    Primary: [UNKNOWN] <br>
    Colloquial: The Concave Emptiness, or Cave <br>
    Isle: The <span id="concept">Isle of Isolation</span> <br><br>
    Retrieving first imperative... <br>
    Command located <br>
    First command: Transport finished product to coordinates. Unable to retrieve spatial data. Command issued approx. 4.5e9 years ago. <br><br>
    Retrieving current imperative... <br>
    Command located <br>
    Current command: Withheld. Access to full message and time of writing requires administrative authorization. <br><br>
    The Concave Emptiness is primarily described as 'bowl-like'; representative of both the ship and its cargo, their head is a pair of nested bowls 
    and the rest are light projections operating as hair, an eye and arms.
