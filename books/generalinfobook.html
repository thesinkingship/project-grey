                        <p>This book details the worldbuilding of the universe the story is set in 
                            and the summary of each Isle present. 
                            Strangely enough, there isn't an exact name for this whole project, so 
                            as a stand-in it's called Project Grey. You know. From grey matter. <br><br>
                            This specifically focuses around the ship and the planet as suggested by the cover art; the 
                            other stuff outside the ship will come later.
                        </p>

                        <p>The general gist of the story is that a giant planet is imprisoned inside this big ship. 
                            It's initially supposed to be delivered to a specific destination, though multiple 
                            malfunctions have occurred: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>The planet is <i>far</i> bigger when in its atmosphere than its containment suggests due 
                                to a spatial malfunction. As in, each biome seen from afar is like looking into a porthole if that 
                                makes sense.</li>
                                <li>The automated driver responsible for actually getting the planet to its destination was, for 
                                    lack of a better word, tricked into sending it into TON-618. It hasn't done so due to a crash knocking 
                                    them clean out and halting transport until a human spirit entered several billion years later. 
                                    Said crash also resulted in life sort of glitching: sapient life cannot evolve, instead god-like entities 
                                    form spontaneously due to unaddressed damages as a measure to generate ship staff.
                                </li>
                                <li>The manufacturers of the ship, the robot and the planet have long since gone extinct.</li>
                            </ul>
                            So the whole thing that they do is they aimlessly explore solar systems, celestial bodies, other  
                            universes, wherever, as well as explore the world stored inside. 
                            I've yet to actually give them a sort of goal point???
                        </p>

                    <div class="page-left" id="gl2">
                        <p>The world stored inside the ship is simply referred to (as of current) as The Marble, as its previous designation was 
                            lost. As of current. <br>
                            As already written, it's expansive on its surface as compared to beyond its atmosphere - entering it through said atmosphere reveals the 
                            horizon rising from the curvature of a sphere almost to what could be mistaken for a flat plane. The descent into the 
                            Marble is as if delving into a fractal. <br>
                            It is not formally mapped. Any setting is possible. That being said, there should be some regions mapped out... hmm. Then again 
                            this is a work in progress, so. Not yet. Maybe it shouldn't be categorized or mapped at all.<br><br>
                        </p>

                    <div class="page-right" id="gr2">
                        <p>What is most definite is that each Isle has their own personal realm. Accessible via either round the ship or somewhere 
                            in the Marble, they're little pocket dimensions that function as personal rooms akin to servers with a password lock 
                            rather than outright singleplayer servers. Each realm resembles each Isle's personal tastes, aesthetics and 
                            symbols associated with them; if they are lodged somewhere within the Marble, these themes will bleed into the surrounding 
                            environment. To counter this, they are <i>extremely</i> hard to get to without assistance from the corrisponding Isle. 
                            The designs range from simple houses to great kingdoms.

                        <p> The ship itself has various functions. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Shrink and magnify as a whole. Time dilation is accounted for - see the Nameless' entry.
                                </li>
                                <li>Intake of materials - this is primarily to sample and regenerate. Getting out said materials is extremely 
                                    hard due to restrictions placed upon the ship due to the spatial malfunction - an infinite realm can't just 
                                    spew infinite matter into the universe, after all.
                                </li>
                                <li>The creation of attachments to the ship. This generally includes FTL thrusters of various kinds as they are not initially 
                                    built into the system (trips to transport planets are supposed to take billions of years according to the now-extinct 
                                    planet manufacturers) or attachments made to simulate a body e.g. shrinking -> enter world -> form body into the shape 
                                    of the locals with the ship in place of the head.
                                </li>
