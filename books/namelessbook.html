                        <p>The owner of this pamphlet has no name, currently. 
                            They are, also currently, the operator of the ship 
                            that houses the shelf that houses the books. <br>
                            They are extremely indecisive. <br><br>
                            The specific concept they associate with is
                            <span id="concept">isolation</span>,
                            mostly that of the feeling of exploring empty places, 
                            such as those that inspire the feeling of liminality. 
                            Because of this, they have little need for such concepts as 'names', and they 
                            have difficulty on deciding unless the answer is a no-brainer or 
                            with a third option. <br><br>
                            They are aware of the irony of being a travelling ship
                            full of passengers. But unlike them and their amiability,
                            they are rather irritable in the presence of others,
                            and can take being truly isolated for months on end. <br>
                            The other passengers interpret this as denial.

                            they would generally be left alone to their devices, and
                            have a tendency to also get anxious when faced with a situation that
                            relies on communication. Other Isles may aid with such procedures. <br><br>
                            Beyond their station, they are generally <i>not</i> observed adventuring through
                            the ship and the world held inside; due to their power being conserved towards
                            piloting the ship, they have little power over changing the landscape to their will. <br><br>
                            They are associated with the cards <b>The Fool</b> and <b>The Hermit</b>, 
                            alongside fog and low clouds, lanterns, being betwixt and between, crossovers, contrast, coconut shells, gacha capsules and bowls. <br><br>
                            Based on Dante from Limbus Company, The Little Prince and Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean. 
                            Takes heavy inspiration from the Backrooms, Aperture Science and Myst-like escape room games.
                            They <i>would</i> have taken up other aesthetics, most particularly that of the I-Spy / Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium kind, 
                            but has supposed that other Isles would make better use of them.

                        <p>What do they <i>look</i> like, exactly? <br>
                            Generally it's not really anything of your business. <br>
                            But it's something of a robot. It is generally understood that they're the embodiment of the ship.
                            Lore states that the Nameless was actually manufactured to be, well, some sorta 
                            ship driving robot, which explains the whole lack of identity and 
                            not caring if they're alone thing. <br>
                            Their species? uhhhhh uhhh let's just say they're like. a product of something
                            equivalent to a Magrathean. Said Magrathean-likes went extinct already, this last robot 
                            willing to take the planet to its final destination. However, the 
                            planet is defective - spatially defective - infinitely bigger on the surface than in containment 
                            and from a distance, and so cannot be ejected from the ship at any point, though materials 
                            can freely enter, though it's much harder for materials to <i>exit</i>, despite the abundance. 
                            It's downright impossible for people to enter and exit, and Isles cannot exit or enter period.
                            Yes, this is an invitation to universe-ending gluttony. Anyways, the Nameless doesn't have 
                            much of an interest to do so.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-right" id="nlr2">
                        <p>Powers. Powers, powers. Not many, unfortunately. They're an observer. <br>
                            Their main prowess is just piloting said ship and operating any extensions built - 
                            actually turns out they're the whole reason they could modify the size of the ship.
                            It can shrink to about the size of a dandelion seed - yes, the bit on the end of the fluff - 
                            up and past the size of the Oort cloud. Time dilation will adjust to an even flow of time calibrated,
                            currently, to Earth humans as a result of the <b>Isle of Novelty</b> showing up. Previously, 
                            the ship had been progressing at a sort of accelerated time passage with slowing down in order to 
                            dodge obstacles. <br>
                            The size of the content and therefore passengers inside the ship remain at the same size relative to the ship: 
                            should the size be adjusted to the point where the planet shown inside is the same size to the Earth, 
                            the people inside remain approximately the same size as the average human, should they decide to present as such.

                        <p>Favorite places: <br>
                            Since the realm is sort of... unmapped in this current state, 
                            there isn't really much they could do to describe the areas they go to. 
                            So there's more of a lore dump: The places the Nameless drives the ship to, outside of the 
                            generic rocky planet, are generally described as Megastructures. 
                            Structures that lie outside of observable space and just lie in another angle in the 4th 
                            dimension Flatland style. Accessible through rifts in reality that allow the observation of 
                            these monuments. The Nameless loooooves these places.
