                        <p>...This Isle isn't the stand in for the devil, by the way. Yes, Hell as the depths of the ocean, 
                            this guy's name meaning - well, whatever you can glean from the <span id="concept">Isle of Deceit</span>... 
                            It should be obvious, right? That's not their deal. <br><br>
                            They are known as the Manloloko. Residing within the depths of the Marble's oceans, presiding over its life 
                            and the aforementioned concept of <span id="concept">deceit</span>, he uses the concept in a more 
                            positive light - surprises, white lies, hidden generosity and bounty disguised as poison. The 
                            benefit side of taking risks, pretty much. <br><br>
                            It doesn't preside over the whole of the oceans: she specifically reigns over the Midnight zone and below. 
                            He has a love for the deep sea beneath, specifically that of sharks at the moment (previously jellyfish). Another 
                            aspect of <span id="concept">deceit</span> they embody is a bit of wonder - specifically pointed to unknown monsters 
                            in the deep dark, and the myths and tales made from the lack of truth. They still have sadness over the gradual 
                            vanishing of awe and appreciation as knowing the unknown causes the effect of disregard e.g. finding the Kraken 
                            is a real animal, but handwaving the resulting discovery of the bizarre animals within the depths after being able to record the bottom 
                            of the sea.

                        <p>Its whole thing is being straight up <i>the</i> generic pirate. Even if it doesn't make any sense with 
                            the level of depth that she's in, they're highly based on Long John Silver in behavior and tone of voice. 
                            Yeah, they'll sound like they're using flattery to the max, and they use it evenly with everyone, but they're 
                            100% being sincere about it even if it sounds like the most face-punch-tempting condescending-sounding 
                            'yeah like you believe what I'm spewing' tone that has ever graced your ears. It then sounds really nice once 
                            you understand what's <i>actually</i> going on. Xe legit just cannot help it. It's always gonna sound too good to be true. <br><br>
