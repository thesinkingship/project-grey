                        <p>The cover of the Marble, the faulty planet hurtling slowly throughout space. <br>
                            While it would have one day opened and deployed a freshly created world, it is now sealed and 
                            cannot leave its eternal bounds; the only saving grace it has, now, is the gravitational 
                            power of a supermassive black hole.<br><br><br>
                            The Husk is comprised of two halves:<br><br>
                            One made of glass fortified beyond all measure and free from reflections, to expose the planet to the night sky.<br><br>
                            The other, a bowl of metals forged from iron stars, to hold its thrusters and 
                            pose as a false albeit sufficient sun and sky. An impossibly immense garden of light, a biochemical wonder,
                            this is a jungle all on its own.<br><br>
                            There is a third structure, a revolving disc that replicates a moon. A half that never changes, it formed and forged itself 
                            to suit the familiarities of its sole human inhabitant. As the tide began, so did operations; this is renewal.

                        <p>Inspirations derive from the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Machinarium</li>

                            <br><br>
                            There are gaps in which Isles can seemingly vacate the Husk.<br><br>
                            This is not possible.<br>
                            They begin to 'fade out' of existence the moment they step outside - as constructs of the ship - 
                            and wake up back inside. Within this fading state they are unable to physically interact or communicate.

                        <p>The half that acts as the night sky is uninhabited, though it is referred to as an ocean in its own right. <br>
                            Some Isles may be observed wandering the skies as the most miniscule specks by telescope or as shooting stars.<br><br>
                            Called the <b>Mirror Lake Ceiling</b> - in spite of it being engineered specifically to have a lack of reflection - 
                            its surface does not feel like glass; there is a strange film of liquid adherent to the floor, but not enough so 
                            to distort the view of the stars as it keeps still. Ripples vanish fast, and the water, if one should 
                            call it that, does not stick to surfaces and seems to always recede back under the set level, so one remains dry at shore. 
                            On average, Isles in humanoid form can be submerged up to just over the top of their heads. If the liquid is stored in a cup, it will 
                            phase through the container - any container - and remain the same as it was. <br><br>
                            It is currently unknown as to which Isle reigns over this ocean, but there is an Isle yet unreported that may be the Lady of the Lake.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-right" id="shr2">
                        <p>The liquid is generally present as far as anyone knows as a countermeasure to internal impacts, 
                            should something be flung towards it. Even still, the glass underneath remains utterly impenetrable. Other uses are 
                            the prevention of the creation of structures, sweeping leftover objects back to the shores of the Garden, which 
                            is the most movement it will operate in as so far observed, and sterilisation.  <br><br>
                            As for the material of the glass, its actual composition is unknown. No samples to date can be taken due to its 
                            inability to be damaged in any form. Scans show that this layer of glass, beyond the liquid layer, is comprised of multiple layers 
                            and sections. Between these layers may be an adhesive of unknown make, and the outer layer 
                            must be some sort of shock absorbent material.<br><br>
                            As the permanent night sky, the Husk, within range of a star, will always revolve the glass half away from the light emitted 
                            by it to prevent possible overheating from being too close and for the metal half's outer surface to generate power.

                    <div class="page-left" id="shl3">
                        <p>The half that acts as the day contains the rest of the Husk's primary functions.<br><br>
                            <b>Solar Power</b><br>
                            Lined with rows of solar panel cells, moving from star to star is essential. Energy 
                            consumption remains efficient despite the setup seeming otherwise. FTL requires 
                            prolonged exposure dependent on intended distance.<br><br>
                            <b>Controls</b><br>
                            Steering, orientation, administrative orders. The <b>Isle of Isolation</b> remains here. Thrusters also line the edge 
                            of the Husk, though they're relatively slow compared to FTL.<br><br>
                            <b>Size Adjustment</b><br>
                            In the Controls, the ship is able to shrink and magnify. It is currently unknown as to <i>why</i> 
                            this occurs, but it has something to do with the same defect the Marble had. Something to do 
                            with scaling upon entry to it, utilised for this purpose.<br><br>
                            <b>Material Intake</b><br>
                            There is a large hatch at the lower section of the Husk. This is only used to take temporary 
                            samples as often times the relatively thin layer of the Husk doesn't allow mass storage.<br><br>

                            <b>Extension Design and Deployment</b><br>
                            Using said materials, they can be replicated using the materials taken from the Marble in order to make specialized 
                            appendages or extensions from the lower half of the Husk. These typically range from bodies to temporary FTL thrusters.<br><br>
                            <b>The Floodlight Sky</b><br>
                            A dense ecosystem primarily comprised of a genetically modified tree species that emits an intense light from the top sides 
                            of their leaves, forming the blue skies of the false day. Colour depends on density, emulating that of a typical 
                            sunrise and sunset around the scattered edges and the bright sun being a deeply intertwined tangle. 
                            The Crepuscal, better known as the <b>Isle of Recovery</b>, generally manages this area, tending to the local ecosystem. 
                            Many Isles, however, roam it.<br><br>
                            <b>The Starlight City</b><br>
                            What remains under the leaves.
