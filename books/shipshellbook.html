                        <p>The cover of the Marble, the faulty planet hurtling slowly throughout space. <br>
                            While it would have one day opened and deployed a freshly created world, it is now sealed and 
                            cannot leave its eternal bounds; the only saving grace it has, now, is the gravitational 
                            power of a supermassive black hole.<br><br><br>
                            The Husk is comprised of two halves:<br><br>
                            One made of glass fortified beyond all measure and free from reflections, to expose the planet to the night sky.<br><br>
                            The other, a bowl of metals forged from iron stars, to hold its thrusters and 
                            pose as a false albeit sufficient sun and sky. An impossibly immense garden of light, a biochemical wonder,
                            this is a jungle all on its own.<br><br>
                            There is a third structure, a revolving disc that replicates a moon. A half that never changes, it formed and forged itself 
                            to suit the familiarities of its sole human inhabitant. As the tide began, so did operations; this is renewal.

                        <p>Inspirations derive from the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Machinarium</li>

                        <p>The glass hemisphere is uninhabited, though it is referred to as an ocean in its own right. 
                            Some Isles may be observed wandering the skies as the most miniscule specks by telescope.<br>
                            Called the Mirror Lake Ceiling - in spite of it being engineered specifically to have a lack of reflection - 
                            its surface does not feel like glass; there is a strange film of liquid adherent to the floor, but not enough so 
                            to distort the view of the stars as it keeps still. Ripples vanish fast, and the water, if one should 
                            call it that, does not stick to surfaces and seems to always recede back under the set level, so one remains dry at shore. 
                            On average, Isles in humanoid form can be submerged up to just over the top of their heads. If the liquid is stored in a cup, it will 
                            phase through the container - any container - and remain the same as it was. <br>
                            The liquid is generally present as far as anyone knows as a countermeasure to internal impacts, 
                            should something be flung towards it. Even still, the glass underneath remains utterly impenetrable. Other uses are 
                            the prevention of the creation of structures, sweeping leftover objects back to the shores of the Garden, which 
                            is the most movement it will operate in as so far observed, and sterilisation. It is currently unknown as to which Isle 
                            reigns over this ocean, but there is an Isle yet unreported that may be the Lady of the Lake.
