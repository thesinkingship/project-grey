                        <p>The cover of the Marble, the faulty planet hurtling slowly throughout space. <br>
                            While it would have one day opened and deployed a freshly created world, it is now sealed and 
                            cannot leave its eternal bounds; the only saving grace it has, now, is the gravitational 
                            power of a supermassive black hole.<br><br><br>
                            The Husk is comprised of two halves:<br><br>
                            One made of glass fortified beyond all measure and free from reflections, to expose the planet to the night sky.<br><br>
                            The other, a bowl of metals forged from iron stars, to hold its thrusters and 
                            pose as a false albeit sufficient sun and sky. An impossibly immense garden of light, a biochemical wonder,
                            this is a jungle all on its own.<br><br>
                            There is a third structure, a revolving disc that replicates a moon. A half that never changes, it formed and forged itself 
                            to suit the familiarities of its sole human inhabitant. As the tide began, so did operations; this is renewal.
