                            First command: Transport finished product to coordinates. Unable to retrieve spatial data. Command issued approx. 4.5e9 years ago. <br><br>
                            Retrieving current imperative... <br>

                            Current command: Withheld. Access to full message and time of writing requires administrative authorization. <br><br>
                            The Concave Emptiness is primarily described as 'bowl-like'; representative of both the ship and its cargo, their head is a pair of nested bowls 
                            and the rest are light projections operating as hair, an eye and arms.

                        <p>They are a projected drone built to operate as a captain to and maintain the Husk, thereby reflecting its design in their own self. Delivery of the 
                            package to its destination is their only intention. As they were built to operate at a solitary level, their artificial intelligence is not as well capable of interaction 
                            or emotional engagement as their Isle peers. As such their general philosophy towards 'life', or what can be loosely defined as it, is that they hate 
                            redundance and events defined as 'time wasting'. They have a tendency to drift away from others outside the Husk for this reason. 
                            Despite this, they still <i>are</i> in some capacity and enjoy the company of their friends as being with the other Isles or working with them 
                            is not categorised under this event tag. <br><br>
                            They enjoy places that are typically recognized as 'liminal' to most, the 'Isolation' of their title shining at its brightest in these situations.

                        <p>The time at which they began to start feeling and 'being' is approximately when the Isle of Novelty, An Edict To Establish, otherwise 
                            known as Edith, entered via the Husk's <a href="shipshellbook.html">captain substitution protocol</a>, after which Edith simply reactivated 
                            Cave and gave them the command to protect her and continue on as normal. It was unknown as to what happened: had Edith's humanity 
                            influenced Concave that badly, it had resulted in other imperatives other than simply straightforward delivery. <br><br>
                            Additionally, Cave realized that the destination marked was the singularity of TON-618. <br><br>
                            They supposed that could wait.
                        </p>

                    <div class="page-right" id="nlr2">
                        <p>The entire scope of the places they adore are the truly empty. The places one knows that the zone is utterly privy to them, such as 
                            icy deserts, foggy tundra, storage rooms late at night, abandoned malls. <br><br>
                            Because of this association with loneliness, cold, oblivion, transitions and technology, they are generally regarded as a machine that heralds 
                            death. Not death in the idea of something terrifying, as age does not take here, but as an option and a finality that all must agree to and Cave 
                            will be the one to deliver it. <br><br>
                            It is predicted that as much Cave will grieve, they will return to their factory state and initial imperative prior to this event. Even they can get tired, 
                            and all Isles will come to tire of existence at approximately the time the final star collapses.

                        <p>Here are their relations.<br><br>
                            Edith is regarded as their little sister. Cave, admittedly, tends to weep whenever she is experiencing anything positive. <br><br>
                            The Lens Prismatic is regarded as their closest friend, often working together in tandem whenever the Prismatic sees fit.<br><br>
                            The other Isles tend to hang around intermittently at the pilot room as co-captains. As a blanket statement, they're just friends they sometimes 
                            hang out with, but they seem to display some form of concern - it seems that the collision that caused the captain substitution protocol, due 
                            to the damage offloading entirely upon Cave at the time, has caused something to both them and the rest of the Isles resulting in Cave's paranoia.
