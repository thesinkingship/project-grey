                        <p><b>The King of the Cambrian, <br>
                            The Deity Subterranean, <br>
                            The Dreaded <span id="concept">Isle of Burial.</span></b> <br><br>
                            A reclusive prehistoric creature that relinquished his previous rule of the seas in favor of the suffocating underground. 
                            The right of ownership has since then been passed to the <a href="manlolokobook.html"><b>Isle of Deceit</b></a>. <br><br>
                            Fossilization, sculptures, claustrophobia, mourning and equilibrium in death is his reign. Additionally, he is a 
                            judge of transactions: the Paleonome is able to grant almost anything to you, if you are willing to 'die' for it. <br><br>
                            The process involves burying oneself alive for a set amount of time proportionate to the wish. Despite his reputation, as shared 
                            by the shifty Manloloko, he is a fair king and is willing to negotiate what is not egregious.

                        <p><i>This story I am about to recall is false. This is his claim, it is inconsistent and the only lie the Paleonome tells. 
                            The Manloloko always held the depths, and even entered before him; this lie is mutually upheld as per a vague deal along the lines of a bit.</i><br><br>
                            Also known as the Paleonaut in his reign of the sea, he was once truly <i>cruel.</i> Might made right, 
                            and he was always correct in one way or the other. <br>
                            Dissatisfaction wrought the seas of the Marble; all feared being dragged down to the depths. In this amount of stress the 
                            realm formed a new Isle upon the waters. This deceiver and this tyrant battled for many days, enough so that the very tectonic plates, vast as they were, 
                            shifted to their conflict, and in its finality, the Paleonaut was ultimately bested. There, the Manloloko stayed, but not without great 
                            mirth and celebration that the spectacle eventually ended.

                        <p>Aside from the Manloloko, some other Isles have relations to him. Such is the following that have affinity with the 
                            rocks (and regrettably do not have entries upon the shelf yet):<br><br>
                            - The Wellspring Calcified, also known as the <b>Isle of Craving</b> and presides over crystals and geodes. Their relationship is nebulous, as sometimes they bicker, their 
                            conflicts spawning earthquakes, or sometimes they make crystallized fossil sculptures as evidence of a truce. <br><br>
                            - The Green-Lace, the <b>Isle of Cultivation</b>. The Paleonome is... concerned, to say the least, about her. Her own unnamed 
                            regrets seem to have her treating herself as if she were rotten compost to be buried - plants grow upon the tomb set for her, 
                            and the Paleonome, looking for an excuse for carrying out the 'price', gives her these rare herbs and flowers to use in her 
                            tinctures.
                        </p>

                    <div class="page-right" id="pnr2">
                        <p>There are three other Isles that have not been properly registered yet that are also connected to the stone and the rock: <br><br>
                            - A metallurgist that presides over metalworking and ores, as well as working with the materials taken from outside of the ship. The third of the kings of ancient stone, 
                            but the Paleonome and the Calcified don't acknowledge him on basis of him being more technologically advanced than primal.<br><br>
                            - An excavator-sculptor, a canary, an explorer, the masoner, the chisel. The Paleonome's more amused by him than anything, and doesn't exactly think he belongs here. 
                            He theorizes that this chisel must work at the tundra, the ice, and often questions his presence.<br><br>
                            - And a historian mage-knight. Honestly he just goes to the Paleonome for imports of stone for the castle he reigns over.
