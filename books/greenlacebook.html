                        <p>A quiet herald of spring, herbs and flowers, the sunrise that exists only in secret gardens.<br>
                            The <span id="concept">Isle of Cultivation</span> would rather remain as wafts 
                            of something familiar in empty libraries, a figure among the foxgloves, a lingering butterfly.<br><br>
                            Should you ever find a woman in the fields, <br>
                            clad in embroidered green, a beaked mask filled with petals,<br>
                            do take care, and wander slowly away.<br>
                            Do not acknowledge that she was ever there.<br>
                            It is not often that she wishes to speak with others.<br><br>
                            As mentioned before, she has an utter myriad of subtleties as her forms, a mere will o' the wisp, 
                            a cloud of butterflies. Titles include the Wraith of the Leviathan Archives, the Flowering Rot, 
                            the Spring-Queen, and, once upon a time, a time that was forever false, 'professor'.<br><br>
                            As of yet, there is not much to say about her yet. Time in the chrysalis for this specific version 
                            is still passing.
