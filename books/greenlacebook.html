                        <p>This account may be false, as with others.<br><br>
                            There was once a vile prince that ruled upon his throne within a castle, and there it had been shrouded with a great forest, where 
                            it was not known to the rest of the world. His subjects did not admire his sharp tongue nor tendency to administer punishment for perceived wrongdoings.
                            Whatever he said went, whatever he wished was so. Everything was granted to him upon a silver platter, and the prince, even then, would not be satisfied 
                            but with the finest of garments, treasures and delights. He was so vile that he had taken the life of the previous king, a kindly yet permissive ruler, 
                            with little hesitation upon which to usurp the throne, and there he ruled upon his subjects by way of dread. <br>
                            Many speculated as to the reason for his perpetual anger. <br> <br>
                            The truth, a truth the prince would not tell, was that he had a rose. It was enchanted so that it would speak, it would think, and it would love. <br>
                            His beloved rose, a rose that spoke and understood his plights, his secrets, his anguishes that  he had brought to the grave, had wilted 
                            by the order of the king. He could not stand to see his heir so attached to the rose, but the prince remained, clutching its planter close to his chest 
                            even as the rose had long since died away. Whenever the prince was not overseeing the punishment of another, he was closed up 
                            within his room, hoping that his beloved would speak to him once more.

                        <p>One night, the prince made a single wish to his rose. He uncovered it and wept into its petals, the thorns piercing his skin.<br>
                            "My sweet, fragrant rose," <br>
                            "I have begged for you to come back to me again and again, I demanded it of all of existence, of all the higher powers that be, of all the lights in 
                            the sky, to return you home to my arms." <br>
                            "I have bargained, I have shouted, I have executed in your name, and I will continue to do so without hesitation. However..." <br>
                            "This is the one thing I haven't told you, my dearest, loving rose, where my only joy in your passing is that you would never understand this wish." <br>
                            "You are the only source of my jealousy, o rose," the prince admitted. <br>
                            "How I desired your elegance, how carefree you were, your beauty, I covet it so. It is the sole wish that cannot be granted to me, and it is the one wish I cannot 
                            ask of my worthless, idiotic subjects. And here you are, now reduced to petals in your departure. Now that I know you are truly gone, I have nothing of worth."
                            <br><br>
                            By simple chance, a snake had crept into his room whilst he slept. As if holding the anguish of all his tormented subjects 
                            (so they claimed it to be, once the news had spread the following morning), it had bitten the prince's exposed neck. The venom was incurable, and he was 
                            buried with the collapse of the kingdom.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-left" id="prl1b">
                        <p>For hundreds of years, the kingdom lay quiet until not even the rubble was to be found. Not even the graveyards remained, and all that was 
                            left was a single mound of dirt where the prince had been buried. <br> <br>
                            One morning, a flower had begun to grow upon the barren earth. It would be deemed impossible. The venom of the snake and the prince's vileness 
                            had resulted in the inability for plants to grow, even green grasses. It, too, was enchanted; this was what she thought. <br>
                            "Woe upon myself, forever and evermore," she wept, for she believed she was the very prince she had grown upon. <br>
                            "I do not deserve another chance at this wretched life, for I had begotten misery in my wake. Here, in my loneliness, I shall suffer forever and ever.
                            It is my only right in this world." <br>
                            The flower was not aware that she was not the prince. Had she been told, still and stubbornly, she would not let go of his identity. Her petals contained the venom that 
                            had killed the prince, and the flower's woe continued when she had killed the bees that had gathered her pollen. <br> <br>
                            Her sorrow and her belief remained so endless that, as time weathered on, she began to assume the form of the prince. Whether or not his soul 
                            truly had transformed into the flower remains unknown to this day.

                            The <span id="concept">Isle of Cultivation</span> would rather remain as wafts 
                            of something familiar in empty libraries, a figure among the foxgloves, a lingering butterfly.<br><br>
                            Should you ever find a person in the fields, <br>
                            clad in embroidered green, a beaked mask filled with petals,<br>
                            do take care, and wander slowly away.<br>
                            Do not acknowledge that they were ever there.<br>
                            It is not often that they wish to speak with others.<br><br>
                            As mentioned before, they have an utter myriad of subtleties as her forms, a mere will o' the wisp, 
                            a cloud of butterflies, trails of flowers under the feet of those in her presence. 
                            Titles include the Banshee of the Leviathan Archives, the Flowering Rot, 
                            the Prince of Life, and, once upon a time, a time that was forever false, 'professor'.<br><br>
                            As of yet, there is not much to say about her yet. Time in the chrysalis for this specific version 
                            is still passing.
                        </p>

                        <p>They wield something between a conductors baton and a rapier, one solidified from pure light as a gift. 
                            Beware whenever it is used. It is used to command not just the flowers as  it carries the myths of wild abandon and eternal dancing, 
                            though the Green-Lace tires of this method (they are not overtly tolerant of such cheer) and would rather interlopers just leave one way or another. <br><br>
                            Despite their utterly solitary nature, they are often sought for in solace regarding heavy emotions and even heavier intellectual topics; she 
                            is the patron of the Leviathan Archives, not a part of their own realm, but a library she has taken precedence over regarding natural sciences 
                            and disciplines related to such matters. <br><br>
                            They often find themself in intentional debt to the Isle of Burial, insistent on burying themself for long periods of time to 
                            wallow in deathly sorrows - because she stays in the catacombs longer than the payments he asks, he finds himself often at a loss to what to 
                            give her as compensation other than the bounties of glorious herbs and flowers that sprout 
                            out of the rock where she had laid, for the sake of a suitable payment. She is equally insistent that the outlet of it all is more than sufficient.

                        <p>Her voice is described as, according to her own account, 'velvety, smooth, bitter, a warm matcha coffee'. This is correct. Whatever that means to 
                            you. In my opinion (to wit, the scribes are currently the subject at hand and the Isle of Isolation), it's more like dark choco, espresso and the slightest saving grace of a dollop of honey. 
                            <br><br>She does know how to have some sort of fun - though, only with a small collective of friends, a popped bottle of wine and a quiet soundtrack 
                            are the prime of her enjoyment.<br><br>
                            The Green-Lace's friendships are treated as mere acquaintances, though they cherish their fellow Isle as much as any other: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Isle of Initiation, or the Lens Prismatic, is a fond friend of the Green-Lace - even if she does directly regard them as an utter 
                                    gnat. Regardless, they do seem to share several aspects of their domains. Both of them are classified as strictly fey with according 
                                    environments. They often call each other nicknames from annoyance or a desire to annoy one another, but otherwise remain amiable.
                                </li>
                                <li>The Isle of Isolation contributed to her mental wellness, to the Nameless' surprise. Even to the point where they've had to snap 
                                    the Green-Lace out of it, changing her from the Isle of Sorrow to the Isle of Cultivation over time.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-right" id="prr3">
                        <p><ul>
                            <li>There is an unnamed Isle she has taken responsibility for for the meantime. His name will not be listed, but he's a timid, affected sort and generally 
                                considered to be a younger-brother/poor-stowaway-tagalong figure.</li>
                            <li>The Isle of Novelty, or the Edict, is a friend of hers. They teach each other things, of reactions, of how to deal with reactions, of how to react.</li>
                            <li>As listed before, the Isle of Burial, the Paleonome. The two Isles of the Earth - him of the rock, her of what grows out of the soil, regard each other 
                                as only professional trades-partners. Which seems rather confusing due to how intrinsically emotional their transactions have been, but the Lace 
                                refuses to open up to the Paleonome despite his concerns. They do relate to each other on the occasion, though.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Green-Lace, the Crepuscal and the Noxlilium form a Hecatean triad, the Green-Lace as the Crone. Whilst the Crepuscal is known to have healed the Green-Lace a bit, 
                                it still remains unknown as to their overall relationship, but they are known to communicate long distance by way of sending fireflies. It is 
                                impossible to ascertain the messages being said, though it is suspected to be a form of Morse code. It's confirmed that they are mainly diagnostic reports of environmental statistics on both halves of the Husk and the 
                                Marble, as whenever something is amiss, these three are the first to know and inform.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="page-left" id="prl4">
                        <p>Regarding her being the previous Isle of Sorrow, the entity she had copied herself from was not the most ideal; she was deeply aware of this fact, 
                            and she could not part from it easily. She will not state who it was that she 'was', but plenty are there to assure her that she is not that person, 
                            and was never. Regardless, the Green-Lace still remains with the point that there is still a connection, a familiarity, a weird assertion that cannot be 
                            broken that she was, indeed, that person, and that she should atone as such.<br><br>
                            While this story has been exaggerated for dramatic effect by her suggestion, in truth one day her arms had been and then been not flesh, this 
                            account is presented...<br>
                            In horror at the hand that struck and the arm that bore, she had, in her grief and anger, ripped both off. She then fitted herself with arms of metal, 
                            the act symbolic of becoming anew. Why she hadn't simply made something more fit to her domain is easy to ask. The answer? She simply doesn't care. <br>
                            This act is actually not the first time this has occurred. One time, an Isle - the Isle of Pressure - had ripped off his face and gouged out his chest to change his 
                            self to a living barometer.
